# Twitter-Event-Detection

## Intro: 
  -this project aims to provide solution for data scientist that works in the area of
  twitter even detection. this site will alow them to compare between diffrents alghoritms and to watch at the
  visualizations result of the classification between algorithms that runs over the same data sets.
## Answers: 
  - save a local db. for all received tweets for reuse. 
  - probably two parallel threads - first is a requests listener from front end, second for tweets requests from twitter.
  - sol for Import Problem: move import files into its dir.   
  - sol fro Sum: find summarization for most important words, get most important words with POS (part of speech), language model bert (humming face) - given a word it will tell     the next word (can do fine tuning). *for now i suggest searching for an existing algorithms or models for it (ask Maor, maybe he knows)*
  - did maor implement code that transfers db. format to sedwik format? *I assume he did, but not sure about it*
